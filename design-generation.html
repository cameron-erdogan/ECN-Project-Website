                        <p>
                            We spent months conducting extensive research on disaster mitigation, and interviewed subject matter experts and hurricane
                            survivors in Puerto Rico. We created artifacts in the form of the user personas and journey maps
                            to illustrate the experience of potential end users during and after a natural disaster. At this
                            point, we began ideating solutions to the overall problem we had uncovered: communication.
                        </p>
                        <p>We generated designs in a series of sprints to rapidly iterate solutions based on our research and
                            artifacts from Puerto Rico. Towards the end of our design generation phase, we invited Eaton
                            to co-create solutions using existing Eaton products and services.

                        <p>From our research, we identified a few technological concepts that are ripe for use as a design material
                            in a disaster recovery context. These concepts became "areas of exploration" and served as a
                            starting point for many generated designs</p>

                        <h2>Conceptual Design Sprints</h2>
                        <p>Our design sprint system incorporated rapid design iteration, competitive analysis, and quick design
                            turnover. The idea was to, at first, prioritize quantity over quality. The theory goes that by
                            quickly generating many designs you generate a wide variety of ideas that you're not immediately
                            attached to, allowing for more objective critique. From this, high quality-yet-unexpected ideas
                            could emerge</p>

                        <p>Below is our sequence of design exercises that we performed to generate and subsequently narrow our

                            mitigation professionals that we interviewed, to get expert feedback for each scenario. While
                            user testing our scenarios, we began the technical feasibility of each idea, including the use
                            of drones in dangerous situations, satellite technology, and information management during a
                            disaster.

                            are commercially unviable to be ubiquitous. In scenarios that involve the transfer of critical

                            We ran a codesign session with the Eaton design team, to co-create solutions for post-diseaster communication. This combined
                            our research knowledge with Eaton's extensive industry knowledge. We created 3D stories with
                            figures and props
                            <a href="https://experience.sap.com/designservices/approach/scenes">(which can be found here)</a> to embody real disaster environments.</p>

                        <p>Smart streetlights contain cellular-connected sensors. Sensors update the cloud with streetlight
                            network health. In a disaster, some of the lights will be destroyed. This will reflect in network
                            status visualizations when a node stops transmitting data. Data is then given to first responders
                            to assess overall damage as needed. Often, there are not systems in place to collect information
                            required to distribute resources.</p>

                        <p>Mesh-networked (LAN) connected street lights provide publicly accessible wifi. LAN remains accessible
                            when Internet and power go out in a disaster. Connecting to wifi redirects to an emergency contact
                            web application. Civilian responses are saved to a network database.</p>
                        <p>

                            Drones with mesh-network modules can fly by and wirelessly download the databases. Affected civilian “mail” is then sent
                            to first responders and other civilians.</p>
