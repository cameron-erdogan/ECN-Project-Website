                            the next ten years, in disaster-prone regions around the world.

                        <p>Since this is a service model, there needs to be a co-creation of value with each of the stakeholders.
                            Each one of these stakeholders helps us in a different way.

                                <p>The partnership with the drone companies is critical for the success of our service solution.
                                    We (Eaton) help them by not only creating brand awareness, but also creating new revenue
                                    streams for them. These revenue streams are in the form of the customized drones that
                                    need to be built to become a part of the mesh network, as well as the training program
                                    for the first responders. Apart from that, they can also help us by evaluating the area
                                    and determining the number of drones that will be needed to cover the area.

                                <p>Although private organizations may seem like an unusual stakeholder, we must establish partnerships
                                    with them as they will be the stakeholders who will invest in our hardware. They can
                                    install ECN hardware in various locations and by doing so, they have successfully managed
                                    to mark their location as a disaster resilient location. The feature in our first responder
                                    portal where you can determine whether a node is working or not can be used for maintainance
                                    optimization in their helping them manage their resources better. Our hardware solution
                                    can also be built onto other Eaton products that they might have invested in already.

                                    is mainly catered to their needs and with time, our estimations are going to get more

                                    them because they know about their area the most, and data provided by them will be accurate
                                    and reliable. In return, we can help them by giving them better infrastructure and the
                                    first responder portal which is powered with accurate, real time data. Federal governments
                                    can also make drills mandatory where early onboarding of the disaster survivors can be
                                    done and with the training program, the first responders can fly drones to the node locations.

                            manufacturing departments. The R&D department also needs to work closely with the drone companies
                            to create a node that can be mounted onto the drone.
