                <h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
                <p>According to global statistics, natural disasters are increasing in strength and frequency. Shifting weather
                    patterns make predictions and emergency planning difficult. To make matters worse, populations in vulnerable
                    coastal areas and urban centers have spiked in the past decade, increasing the overall destruction of
                    each disaster.</p>

                        <h2>2017</h2>
                        <p>was the costliest year in United States history for natural disasters. Wild fires, hurricanes, and
                            floods cost $306 billion in damage.</p>
                    </div>

                <h2>Long Term Effects</h2>
                <p>In 2017 natural disasters killed over 2000 people, but also caused incalculable long term health effects.
                    Heat waves are a major factor in heart attacks and strokes. Smoke inhalation from wildfires has been
                    directly linked to long term spikes in asthma and upper respiratory diseases. Hurricanes and flooding
                    can cause pneumonia. Studies have also found up to a 15% increase in mental health issue amongst disaster
                    survivors.

                            Climate change has made regular adverse weather events longer and more severe. Changes in weather patterns have caused more

                            data around disaster patterns and best practices. Existing disaster mitigation plans are often
                            copied from other cities or towns that do not share the same risk factors.</p>

                        <h2>Resilience vs. Recovery</h2>
                        <p>
                            Disaster risk reduction is a holistic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing the risks of disaster. It aims to reduce
                            socioeconomic vulnerabilities to disaster as well as acknowledging the environmental vulnerabilities
                            that trigger them. Resilience is the ability of a system, community or society exposed to disasters
                            to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform and recover from the effects of a disaster
                            in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential
                            basic structures.

                        <p>
                            The Sendai Framework is an international agreement which recognizes that government has the primary role to reduce disaster
                            risk but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders, including the private
                            sector. Unfortunately, governments and communities often do not invest in resilience, in favor
                            of relief, due to resilience being politically unpopular, difficult to fund, and challenging
                            to customize general resilience techniques to specific situations.

                        <h2>The Failure Chain</h2>
                        <p>
                            According to the UN, a failure chain is defined as “a set of linked failures spanning critical assets in multiple infrastructure
                            systems in the city.” When an electricity substation loses power, for example, this may cause
                            a water treatment plant to stop functioning. Any nearby hospital cannot operate without fresh
                            water, thus a region’s entire capability of providing emergency and longterm medical services
                            may be compromised. In this example, the failure chain spans a community’s energy, water, and
                            healthcare systems.
                        </p>

                        </span>
                        <h2>Communication is Key</h2>
                        <p>
                            All facets of communication are weakened during a disaster. Physical infrastructure is affected, making personal communication
                            near impossible. Disaster recovery coordination becomes difficult. Information and important
                            data are lost. Though power is often at the beginning of a failure chain during disasters, mediating
                            the issue of communication can allow people to coordinate resources and move more efficiently
                            than the chaos that often ensues post-disaster.
