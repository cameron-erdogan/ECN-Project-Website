                <h2>High Level Service</h2>
                <p>We designed a service that uses mesh networking and drones to facilitate communication between survivors,
                    their family, and first responders.</p>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            We combined our
                            <a href="design-generation.html">two final designs</a> from the conceptual design phase into something that combined features
                            from both. The core interaction was taken from "Drone Mailman", while the data gathering and
                            visualization from "Data Gathering and Visualization" was added as a key feature. Throughout
                            the first part of our design execution phase, we refined the design through stakeholder interviews
                            and user testing.
                        </p>
                        <p>Eaton Emergency Communication Network (as it was eventually named) consists of a mesh network setup
                            in remote areas to broadcast local wifi to disaster survivors. The mesh creates a local area
                            network, isolated from the greater internet. Survivors can access the wifi to request aid and
                            compose messages to loved ones. These responses are then saved locally. Finally, first responders
                            then send drones out to collect aid requests and messages, where they upload these to the cloud.

                        <h2>Stakeholder Speed Dating</h2>
                        <p>After creating an initial first pass at a fleshed out design, we sought feedback through speed dating-style
                            interviews with stakeholders. These ranged from disaster response professionals to Puerto Rican
                            civilians that had lived through Maria. We wanted to get qualitative feedback, and to understand
                            what parts of the design hit the mark (and which parts didn't).</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of a Speed Date, we provide interviewees with a few pages of background information
                            about the project, like who we were and our problem statement. Then, we show a diagram of our
                            proposed solution. After eliciting some general feedback about the design, we show them storyboards
                            explaining the three scenarios. These scenarios correspond ot the three user types served by
                            our solution: disaster survivors, survivor's family members, and first responders. We sought
                            strong reactions either way, whether positive or negative.</p>
                        <p>

                        <h3>Family Communication</h3>
                        <p>
                            Disaster management experts and civilian interviewees alike agreed with the characterization of familial communication as
                            an important survivor concern.</p>

                        <h3>Accurate Information</h3>
                        <p>After a disaster, first responders must decide what information is accurate. Aggregated aid requests
                            directly from survivors would help them determine where and when to respond. </p>

                        <h3>Response Coordination</h3>
                        <p>Currently, disaster response organizations share information in an ad-hoc manner: either through
                            word-of-mouth, or sharing spreadsheets through email or in-person.</p>

                        <h3>Response Times</h3>
                        <p>
                            Disaster response teams often gather needs assessment data on the ground, going door-to-door to determine where help is needed.
                            This can be very inefficient, especially if roads are blocked.</p>

                        <h3>Multi-Stakeholder Efforts</h3>
                        <p>Larger organizations such as the Red Cross, UN, and FEMA often coordinate with smaller, more targeted
                            organizations like food banks, religious groups, and local medical responders.</p>

                        <p>Both disaster experts and hurricane survivors agreed that mesh network nodes should be placed not
                            only on streetlights, but also in resilient buildings like schools, hospitals, and government
                            facilities.

                        <p>We created a technical blueprint to explain the many moving parts of our design. The underlying components
                            of our design are sometimes confusingly technical, so a clarifying document like this was crucial
