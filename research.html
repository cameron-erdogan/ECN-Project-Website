                            natural disasters (rather than man-made) as natural disasters have been increasingly present
                            in the news, and affect thousands of lives around the world every year.</p>

                        <p>
                            Disaster planning saves money in the long-term, but isn’t often invested in because governments are bound to relatively short-term
                            election and budget cycles. The National Institute of Building Sciences claims that “$1 spent
                            on disaster resilience saves between $4-6 in disaster relief.</p>

                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>Communication is hardest hit during a disaster -- even with resilience plans in place, information
                            flow is impacted by unreliability, difficulty in source identification, and inconsistent data.</p>

                            have been slow to respond to changing weather patterns.</p>

                            Technological innovations such as drones, crowdsourcing apps, predictive analytics, and microgrids are becoming more prevalent

                        The interviews produced hundreds of individual notes, which we analyzed using an affinity diagram. Although each conversation
                        was different, we began to see broad themes within disaster management that showed common difficulties
                        in developing more resilient communities, and enabling disaster response and relief.

                        <p>
                            People acknowledged that they had to shift to renewable energy for a more sustainable future, but were concerned about cost
                            and maintenance.</p>

                        <p>Pre-disaster resilience planning and post-disaster relief both require collaboration of multiple
                            actors, including government, private companies, nonprofits, and community members. While in
                            practice local and federal governments should lead disaster efforts, they often lack the resources
                            to do so, and sometimes have limited control over foreign foreign aid organizations.

                            People often do not take disaster preparation seriously until it is too late, as it is costly and requires high effort. Often
                            it is not politically feasible for governments to spend considerable money preparing for an event
                            that may never occur..</p>

                        <h3>Issues related to Climate Change</h3>
                        <p>Climate change is impacting normal storm patterns, making them more frequent and less predictable.
                            Even though rising sea levels is now common knowledge, more and more people are still moving
                            to the coasts. The combination of densely populated areas with unpredictable climate increases
                            community vulnerability in many areas</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                        <p>When we asked experts why disasters are not predicted fast enough, they stated that there just isn’t
                            enough data to do so accurately. Climate change and lack of long-term data prior to the 20th
                            century make predictive analytics for natural disasters more difficult.</p>
