                <h2>Puerto Rico Case Study</h2>
                <p>We went to Puerto Rico to learn directly from Hurricane Maria survivors.</p>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>In September 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Puerto Rico, taking almost 1000 lives
                            and causing $85 billion in damage. We traveled to Puerto Rico in February 2018 to meet locals,
                            first responders, aid workers, and Eaton employees. We wanted to discover the real impact of
                            a natural disaster on a community. Even six months after the hurricane, 40% of the population
                            was still living without electricity.
                            <br>
                            <br> We anticipated hearing stories about living without power. Instead, we heard stories of silence
                            - always wondering if friends and family were safe, and never knowing when help was coming. Our
                            original goal of reconnecting the lights became reconnecting people.

                        <h2>An Island in the Dark</h2>
                        <p>Through secondary research, we sought to understand Puerto Rico at a broad level before we started
                            travelled and started conducting interviews. We discovered that Puerto Rico has a myriad of factors
                            that worsened the devesation caused by Maria. These factors affected both the immmediate aftermath
                            and long term impact of the storm.

                        <h3>Aging Infrastructure</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico had one of the oldest operating power systems in the United States, much hadn't been
                            updated in 60 years. Power lines and substations were not well maintained, and thus were heavily
                            damaged by flying debris and landslides.</p>

                        <h3>Geography</h3>
                        <p>Puerto Rico is an island in “Hurricane Alley,” a stretch of the Atlantic Ocean prone to tropical
                            storms. Hurricane warnings are so frequent that they often go ignored. As an island, the only
                            entry points for resources are the ports and airports. The center of Puerto Rico is mountainous
                            and difficult to develop.</p>

                        </span>
                        <h3>Centralized Power</h3>
                        <p>Puerto Rico’s electricity is generated in only two locations on the island’s coast, in the direct
                            path of any tropical storm. Hurricane Maria also destroyed many electrical substations, cutting
                            off power for thousands of people on the grid. Electricity is generated by oil and natural gas,
                            both of which have to be imported.</p>

                        <h3>Political Landscape</h3>
                        <p>
                            All power on the island is supplied and maintained by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. (PREPA) The agency
                            was in significant debt before Hurricane Maria, and nearly 60% of its workforce retired within
                            two years before the storm.</p>

                <h2>On the Ground</h2>
                <p>We chose to visit Puerto Rico speak with hurricane survivors, and to visit the Eaton manufacturing plant
                    that had withstood the hurricanes in September 2017. Prior to this, we conducted extensive secondary
                    research, mainly through news articles and online interviews of government officials, relief agencies,
                    and disaster management experts.
                </p>
                <p> We reached out to people in our personal network, and recruited on LinkedIn and through disaster relief nonprofit
                    websites to find interview participants. Our goals were driven by insights derived from secondary research
                    and expert interviews, and were mainly regarding power management issues during disasters. We knew that
                    multi-stakeholder collaboration is an issue in planning for disasters, but assumed that we would find
                    that lack of power would have been everyone’s greatest obstacle.</p>

                    <div class="col-12">
                        <h2>Codesign Session and Collective Story Harvest</h2>
                        <p>We got in touch with a local NGO, ACUDE, before we arrived in Puerto Rico, and met the director of
                            the organization upon touching down on the island. Months after the hurricane, she still did
                            not have power in her home or her office. She travelled to a nearby Starbucks for power and to
                            find cell service. Despite working for a nonprofit working to teach survival skills to help people
                            prepare for disaster, she conceded that the island was not prepared enough. After an insightful
                            interview with ACUDE’s director, she got us in touch with her colleagues for a collective story
                            harvest and participatory design session the next day.</p>
                        <p>We gathered six women and one young man during an afternoon to listen to their stories and understand
                            their ideas for solutions. After splitting into two groups to listen to their stories of what
                            happened before, during, and after Hurricane Maria, we all worked together to co-create an affinity
                            diagram of the largest problem areas that come from a massive natural disaster. They told us
                            their stories of sharing food with neighbors, logistical difficulties of waiting countless hours
                            in line for gasoline, and the loss of family members due to stress and illness. </p>
                        <p>The mood in the room was hopeful, but also reflected a deep disillusionment with aid organizations,
                            private corporations, and government who could not provide the relief that was promised.</p>
                        <p>
                            After reflecting on the broad areas of opportunity to design better solutions, we again broke out into small groups to draw
                            and discuss possible solutions to improve disaster relief and resilience in the future. Their
                            designs involved increasing transparency in aid organization activities, as well as communication
                            solutions to allow victims to reach family members more quickly.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Health</h3>
                        <p>
                            One participant’s brother needs daily kidney dialysis, but did not always have access to the necessary power after the hurricane.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Transportation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The roads were covered in debris after the hurricane, and public utilities were slow to act. After several days or weeks
                            neighbors banded together to clear the roads of trees and branches.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Food/Water</h3>
                        <p>
                            Everyone agreed that food donations from aid organizations were often unhealthy and provided an unbalanced diet. Some people
                            stopped eating for days at a time for fear of not knowing when food would come again.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ATMs and banking systems were down for weeks, so everyone had to pay for basic needs in cash — if you didn’t have change,
                            sometimes an item would cost $20 when it should have been $1.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first thing on anyone’s mind after the hurricane: “Is my family ok?” Dozens of local businesses closed, including big
                            chain stores like Walgreens and Walmart, and employees did not know when they could go back to
                            work and receive income.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Social Impact</h3>
                        <p>
                            Neighbors, friends, and family reluctantly fled from Puerto Rico, as utilities had been too slow to rebuild.

                            We conducted interviews with various groups in Puerto Rico: locals, PREPA (the local energy utility company), business owners,
                            and Eaton employees. These interviews gave us a more complete understanding of multi-stakeholder
                            collaboration in disaster relief, as well as the day-to-day challenges for hurricane survivors.

                        <p>
                            The day we arrived in San Juan, we spoke with a couple from the south of the island, one a doctor and the other passionate
                            animal rescue volunteer. They cited income inequality, systemic poverty, and an unhealthy population
                            as vulnerabilities that were exacerbated by hurricane devastation. No one is prepared to spend
                            months without power — especially those who live paycheck to paycheck. “Hurricane Maria has shown
                            the world how poor Puerto Rico is,” they said. They are proud of their people, but recognize
                            the deep inequalities that cause their neighbors to struggle even more the face of a catastrophic
                            natural disaster. They are hopeful for the future, but remain skeptical of the current system
                            in place to help people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We spent an afternoon with a local of Canóvanas, about 18 miles from San Juan, that was still without power in February.
                            She had to rely on her workplace for Internet, and FEMA for generator fuel and food at home.

                        <h3> Eaton Employee Interviews</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our client, Eaton, arranged for us to visit their manufacturing plant in Arecibo, about an hour west of the capital of San
                            Juan. They scheduled for us to interview ten Eaton employees. They worked in a range of departments,
                            but their stories aligned in one big way: Eaton provided immense support to employees after the
                            hurricanes. We learned that the Eaton manufacturing plant was well-prepared, and got back up
                            and running within two weeks — much sooner than other facilities. They were fortunate enough
                            to work for a large company with the resources to help employees, and were back to work when
                            neighbors often went months without income. The management team at the Arecibo plant helped employees
                            get generators, provided food and water, and started paying employees in cash, all providing
                            support to the people who work there.

                            her home and workplace was destroyed. She now needs to find a way to support her family without
                            power or income.
