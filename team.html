                        in 2012 with a BA in Chinese, Economics, and Politics-Philosophy. Naturally, I have spent my entire
                        career in software. I first worked as Quality Assurance for a healthcare software company in Madison,
                        WI, where I ultimately ran the company’s UX Research Lab. Before coming to CMU I was a Business Analyst
                        for a CRM software company. I am personally passionate about women in tech, and in my free time I
                        ski, bike tour, camp, go to music festivals, and scuba dive. I am especially excited to work with
                        Eaton in the wake of tragedies like Hurricane Maria to use design as a tool for recovery and growth.</div>

                        College in 2012 with a BA in International Studies and Italian. Following graduation, I taught English
                        in South Korea, worked for Amnesty International and Greenpeace in New Zealand, and returned home
                        to Pittsburgh to work for a local nonprofit. I then transitioned into the tech world, originally
                        in a business development capacity, before moving into UX Research three years ago. I freelanced
                        for local startups, as well as worked as a Strategic Design Consultant for design for social innovation
                        firm, Fit Associates. I’m passionate about design for social impact, so I have been thrilled to be
                        part of such a mission-driven team throughout this project. </div>

                        I officially tell people I’m from there. I did my undergrad in Computer Science at Columbia, and
                        afterwards worked as an engineer at Tinybop (a children’s app startup) and at Citi Bike (a bike share
                        system). When I’m not coding, I make music and yell at sports. I am optimistic about the future of
                        technology, with one caveat: we’ll only get to an ideal future if technologists and designers are
                        conscious about their design trajectory. Designing for disaster recovery is a fertile area that shows
                        the power of technology for good. </div>

                        through my final engineering project in the field of Virtual Reality. I graduated in 2016 and since
                        then have worked as a UX Consultant and an Associate Product Manager in a service based company looking
                        at the end to end development of software products in the financial sector. Apart from this, I always
                        want to give back to the society and this project has definitely allowed me to do so. This project
                        allowed me to use my skills as a Product Manager where I could align the project goals with Eaton’s
                        long term goals. It also challenged me to explore the partnerships that would be beneficial to create
                        products within a service environment. Overall, I could not have been on a better project.</div>

                        of Technology Guwahati in 2016 with a Bachelor in Design. After my graduation, I worked for a year
                        as the User Experience Design Lead in CarDekho, India’s largest car search portal. In my free time,
                        you will find me playing with Alexa or Google Home. User-centered design approach is always at the
                        forefront of everything that I do. I am excited about this project because I find this space challenging,
                        especially the part “securely serve power to communities without essential infrastructure needs dependent
                        on power”. Looking forward to come up with something novel.
